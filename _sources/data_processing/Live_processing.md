# Live Processing



#### Goal:

Test test tes




## Cryosparc

Cryosparc live can be accesed http://localhost:39106 (if you normal cryosparc port is 3900, otherwise add 6 to your normal port). Depending on the speed of collection and how far in the processing pipeling you go, you will need 2-4 GPUs to keep up with live processing.



For cryosparc patch-motion with falcon camera, you will need to excldue final frame (eg with 40 frames, put 39 as it counts from 0)

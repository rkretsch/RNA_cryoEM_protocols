# Import Movies

### Cryosparc

First, the movies collected by the camera must be imported into Cryosparc for further operations to take place. This is done using the job “Import Movies”. Parameters for this job are listed below. Data paths are input as usual and the other parameters are calculated from the microscope settings that were used during data collection.

- Movies data path
- Gain reference path
- Raw pixel size (A)
- Accelerating voltage (kV)
- Spherical aberration (mm)
  - This value is usually 2.7 mm
- Total exposure dose (e/A^2)
